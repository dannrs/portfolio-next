title: About me
description: Hello, my name is Danni Ramdhani Samsudin, an enthusiastic web developer from Sumedang, Indonesia.

I'm an enthusiastic web developer with a passion for building intuitive and engaging web experiences. I primarily use React, specifically Next.js with Typescript, to build most of my [projects](/projects). 

I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and experiment with new technologies, especially when it comes to web development. In one of my [recent projects](/projects), I was messing around with the Spotify API to understand how interacting with third party services works.

I'm also really interested in trying either [Astro](https://astro.build), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) or [Solid](https://solidjs.com). I was planning to do a project with one of those frameworks. You can see my progress on my [Github](https://github.com/dannrs).

Besides coding and sleeping, I love watching football, listening to music, and playing digital card games.
