description: Hello, my name is Danni Ramdhani Samsudin, a highly enthusiastic web developer from Sumedang, Indonesia.

With a background in Computer Science and a strong understanding of Javascript and Typescript, I am deeply passionate about crafting intuitive and engaging web experiences. I specialize in utilizing libraries and frameworks like React and Next.js to build dynamic web applications. Throughout my academic journey, I excelled in projects focused on responsive web design and interactive user interfaces. I possess a keen eye for detail and a collaborative mindset that drives me to create clean and efficient code.

In 2023, I graduated from Sebelas April University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (known as Teknik Informatika in Indonesia). During my studies, I explored different aspects of software development. I delved into UI/UX design, but realized that design might not be my strong suit. I then ventured into Dart and Flutter for mobile app development, but found that my passion lay elsewhere. Eventually, I discovered my true calling in JavaScript and web development. I was captivated by the limitless possibilities it offered and made a conscious decision to focus my full attention on honing my skills in this area.

As a recent graduate, I recognized the importance of showcasing my skills despite my lack of professional experience. To accomplish this, I began building various projects, and one that I'm very proud of is the site you're currently visiting, my portfolio.

For this project, I used the latest Next.js 13 framework, utilizing the `app/` directory. To ensure robust and maintainable code, I wrote the entire portfolio site using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). For styling, I found [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to be a perfect fit, allowing me to create a visually appealing and responsive design. I also incorporated UI components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a popular library based on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), to enhance the user experience. To manage and display blog content, I integrated [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to streamline content updates. For the contact feature, I used [react email](https://react.email/) and [Resend](https://resend.com/), complemented by [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for form validation. I invite you to explore my portfolio to learn more about this and other projects I've worked on [here](./projects).

Through these projects, I hope to showcase my ability to adapt to new technologies and demonstrate my strong problem solving skills. I look forward to contributing my technical expertise and learning from experienced professionals in a collaborative team environment. I am open to exploring any opportunities, whether internships or entry-level positions, that will allow me to grow and make meaningful contributions to web development projects.
